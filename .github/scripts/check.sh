# What this repository checks about itself. `AGENTS.md` §9.
#
# Usage: bash .github/scripts/check.sh
#
# ## Why there is one at all, on a repository with no code
#
# `kolonie-docs#231` made the organisation's hourly worker read each
# repository's check command out of its `AGENTS.md`. A repository that names
# none **stops the run** rather than having one guessed for it — so until
# `kolonie-email#4` this repository was a trap: the first issue labelled
# `agent:opencode` here would have failed for a reason that had nothing to do
# with it.
#
# The honest answer was not `true`. A check command that passes whatever the
# tree looks like teaches the next reader that green means nothing, which is
# `kolonie-docs/AGENTS.md` §10's own argument, and it would have made the trap
# quieter rather than removing it.
#
# So this checks what there is. Today that is Markdown, and all four failures
# below are real ones that have happened to sibling repositories:
#
#   1. a relative link that resolved when it was written and does not now
#   2. a decision file the register never cites, or a row pointing at nothing
#   3. an `M-` number used twice, which §4 of `AGENTS.md` says is the reason
#      this numbering space exists at all
#   4. a secret in the tree, which is §5's first red line
#
# **It grows with the repository rather than being replaced by what comes
# next.** When `workers/` holds code, its tests are added below and these stay:
# a broken link does not stop mattering because there is now a test suite.

# is how that happens.

# scanner that read itself would fail on every run — and the noise would be
# indistinguishable from the finding.
